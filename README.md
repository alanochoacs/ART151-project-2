Project 2 - Generative Composition

This is the completed project files for ART151 Spring 2024's Project 2. The project was create using p5js.org.

This project uses HTML and CSS to create an animation inspired by the animation Come Closer by Hy Hirsch. 
The animation thats the ideas of entrancing the viewer and having multiple stages with differing animations.
Try clicking the mouse to see if anything changes, the placement matters in some of the stages.
The space bar pauses the timer that changes to the next stage.

More information is available in the project guide.
